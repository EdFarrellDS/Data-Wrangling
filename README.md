# Data-Wrangling
Small repository to showcase data wrangling code.

  "MDS_REF: FIT-xxxx": Monash Course Code reference (if code was used in a previous assignment).
  "THEMES": Relevance notes.
  
If you're a current MDS student, please reference if using this code - Monash will catch you eventually, and plaigarism never looks good on an academic transcript.
